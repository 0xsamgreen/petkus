# Introduction

[Why and How zk-SNARK Works](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.07221) is a classic intermediate-level introduction to zk-SNARKs. This is a Python implementation of all the algorithms presented in the first half of the text.

I do not believe the text is implementable as-is, starting at Section 4.6, but I could be mistaken.
